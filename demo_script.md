# PlayerPulse Analytics - Demo Video Script 🎬

**Time Limit:** 3 Minutes
**Goal:** Showcase the problem, solution, tech stack, and a live demo handling "real-time" data.

## 0:00 - 0:30 | The Hook & Problem
*   **Visual:** Stock footage of a frustrated game dev looking at spreadsheets OR a slide showing "Quarterly Reports = Too Late".
*   **Audio:** "Indie game studios live and die by retention. But right now, most devs wait weeks for quarterly reports to spot churn. By then, players are already gone."
*   **Visual:** PlayerPulse Logo & Title Slide.
*   **Audio:** "Introducing PlayerPulse Analytics. The first real-time, AI-powered churn prediction engine built directly for Tableau."

## 0:30 - 1:30 | The Solution & Tech Stack
*   **Visual:** Architecture Diagram (Firebase -> Node.js -> Python ML -> Hyper API -> Tableau).
*   **Audio:** "We built a complete modern data stack. Game telemetry is ingested in real-time. Our Python ML engine—powered by Random Forest and Gradient Boosting—processes this data instantly."
*   **Visual:** Show code snippets of `train_model.py` and GitHub Actions `retrain_model.yml`.
*   **Audio:** "It doesn't just look at the past. It predicts the future. Our models identifying at-risk players with over 85% accuracy, and the system auto-retrains every week via GitHub Actions."

## 1:30 - 2:30 | Live Demo (The "Wow" Moment)
*   **Visual:** Open Tableau Dashboard (The Extension).
*   **Action:** Click the "Refresh Models" button.
*   **Audio:** "Here's the Dashboard. It looks like a native game UI. Right now, we see standard metrics. But let's trigger a live prediction."
*   **Visual:** Show the "Churn Risk" card updating with a list of players. Hover over "High Risk" tag.
*   **Audio:** "Boom. In seconds, PlayerPulse identified 5 specific cohorts at high risk of churning. We can see their IDs and exact probability."
*   **Visual:** Click on "Monetization Opportunities".
*   **Audio:** "It also finds money on the table. These players are high-value targets. A simple 20% discount offer pushed *now* could save them."

## 2:30 - 3:00 | Business Impact & Closing
*   **Visual:** Slide showing "ROI: +25% Retention, +40% ARPU".
*   **Audio:** "With PlayerPulse, studios shift from reactive quarterly reporting to proactive weekly decision making. We're not just reporting churn; we're preventing it."
